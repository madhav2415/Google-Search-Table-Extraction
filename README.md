# Google Video Search Automation using UiPath

## Description
This project automates the process of searching for a specific topic on Google and extracting the top 10 video links available on that topic using UiPath. The robot performs a Google search, extracts the relevant video links from the search results, and stores them in a structured format for further use.

## Requirements
- UiPath Studio (with appropriate version installed)
- UiPath Robot
- Internet Connection
- Google Search (accessible through a browser)
- Google Chrome or Edge browser extension for UiPath Web Automation (required for automation in web browsers)

## Features
- Automatically performs a Google search for a specified topic.
- Extracts the top 10 video links from the search results.
- Stores the video links in a structured format (e.g., CSV, Excel, or a list).
- Provides an easy-to-use solution for web scraping and data extraction using UiPath.

## How It Works
1. **Search Execution:**
   - The robot starts by opening a browser (Chrome/Edge) and navigating to Google.
   - It enters the search term into the Google search bar and triggers the search.
   
2. **Extracting Video Links:**
   - After loading the search results, the robot identifies video links from the search results.
   - The robot extracts the URLs of the top 10 video results.
   
3. **Storing Data:**
   - The extracted video URLs are stored in a CSV or Excel file, depending on the configuration.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Basic error handling is incorporated in case the search doesnâ€™t return results or any other issue arises during the process.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install UiPath Studio:**
   - Download and install UiPath Studio from [UiPath Official Website](https://www.uipath.com/start-trial).
   - Ensure that you have the necessary version of UiPath installed.

2. **Install UiPath Web Automation Extension:**
   - Open UiPath Studio and go to "Manage Packages."
   - Search for the **UiPath.WebAPI.Activities** or **UiPath.UIAutomation.Activities** and install them.
   - Also, install the **UiPath Chrome/Edge extension** by navigating to the browser extension store and enabling the automation features.

3. **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
   - If this project is stored in a GitHub repository, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
   - Open the project folder in UiPath Studio.

4. **Configure the Topic Search:**
   - Update the variable in the workflow for the topic you want to search for (e.g., `searchTopic = "Artificial Intelligence"`).
   - Make sure the UiPath robot has access to the browser and can control it properly.

5. **Run the Project:**
   - Open UiPath Studio and click "Run" to start the automation.
   - The robot will start searching on Google and extract the top 10 video links.

## Output
The output of the automation will be saved in a CSV or Excel file with the following structure:
- **Video Link 1**
- **Video Link 2**
- ...
- **Video Link 10**

You can open the file to view and analyze the extracted video links.


## Troubleshooting
- **No Results Extracted:** Ensure that the UiPath browser extension is installed and the robot has access to the browser.
- **Timeout Errors:** Check your internet connection. The robot might fail to perform the search if the connection is slow.
- **No Video Results:** Google might have changed its page layout. Check if the robot is correctly identifying the search result links.
